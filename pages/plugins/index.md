A plugin is a software component that can extend JDemetra+ functionalities. 
Plugins can be shared between the users and installed individually. The installation procedure is decribed in the [dedicated item](../reference-manual/tools.html#plugins) of the Reference Manual section.
The list below presents the plugins developed by the Bundesbank and available <a href="https://immurb.github.io/" target="_blank">here</a>.
#### **Concur**<br>
The plug-in ConCur supports the controlled current adjustment approach. It supports the storage of the current components and offers graphical tools to compare forecasted and re-estimated figures. Furthermore, a pre-defined summary of the output containing the most important quality measures can be exported to HTML files.
#### **KIX**<br>
The plug-in KIX (German for chain-linked index) has been designed to facilitate the handling of this index type. It offers addition and subtraction of two or more chain-linked time series as well as the computation of contributions of growth.
#### **KIX 2.0**<br>
KIX 2.0 offers addition and subtraction of two or more chain-linked time series as well as the computation of contributions of growth following the concept of annual overlap. Contributions to growth are calculated with the partial contribution to growth approach.
#### **KIX_E**<br>
KIX_E offers addition and subtraction of two or more chain-linked time series as well as the computation of contributions of growth following the concept of one-period overlap. Contributions to growth are calculated with the aid of the Ribe (1999) contribution to growth approach.
#### **KIX-CC**<br>
The program KIX-CC offers for continuously chain-linked indices the aggregation or disaggregation of two or more indices, or the calculation of contributions to growth.
#### **SpecParser**<br>
The plug-in SpecParser is designed to migrate already existing specification files (X-12-ARIMA compatible .spc- and .mta-(meta)-files) to JD+. The plugin automatically translates all relevant information (e.g. time series data, regression variables, specifications) from the X-12-ARIMA spc-files and constructs an analogous seasonal adjustment document in JD+.
#### **TransReg**<br>	
The plug-in TransReg allows the user to carry out grouping and centring of user-defined regression variables in JD+.
