This item explains the tests performed in the time domain, used by
JDemetra+ to assess the quality of the fit and to detect the seasonal
fluctuations. It is divided into two parts. The first part focuses on
the test performed on the residuals from the modelling performed by the
means of the RegARIMA or TRAMO models. The second part discusses
seasonality tests used to identify seasonal fluctuations on different
stages of the seasonal adjustment process.
